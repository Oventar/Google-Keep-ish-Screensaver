press 1 to toggle between movement modes. the modes being the following:

wrap: when a shape hits the border, it reappears on the opposite side of where it went.

bounce: when a shape hits the border, it bounces. Yes, just like that famous DVD screensaver

these names are in fact, used in the sketch.js code somewhere. I'm pretty sure it's past line 100, idk. I am also a new "programmer", so the functions arent as advanced as they could be. thats all for now.

night mode releasing soon i hope

enjoy the free screensaver/wallpaper/code whatever you wanna call it,
