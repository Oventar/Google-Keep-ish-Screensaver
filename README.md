press 1 to toggle between movement modes. the modes being the following:

wrap: when a shape hits the border, it reappears on the opposite side of where it went.

bounce: when a shape hits the border, it bounces. Yes, just like that famous DVD screensaver

pressing 2 toggles night mode if you're a creep and use a different mode than your browser btw

enjoy the free screensaver/wallpaper/code whatever you wanna call it
