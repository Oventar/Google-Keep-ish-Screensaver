it's a little visual sandbox/screensaver thing where a bunch of shapes float and bumble around your window tab thing. heres some cool stuff you can do with it:

  toggle physics modes - you can switch between bounce (shapes BOUNCE off the edges, like the dvd screensaver) and wrap (they WRAP to the other side of the screen once they pass the border).

  "smart" wall behavior - collision logic is set up so shapes don’t get stuck in walls most of the time, just try not to switch from wrap to bounce mode while a shape is on the border of your screen.

  Auto reset - there's also a stuck-detection system that watches for shapes that stop moving or "glitch out" as you normies would say, and it automatically resets everything after a short countdown of about 10 seconds, maybe 5, idk man it's 3 in the morning let me sleep.   if that doesnt work you can also refresh it, i made this in 3 days and im a freshman in high school please don't judge

  window scaling - A global scale factor that keeps sizes and speeds feeling consistent no matter your screen size.

Controls (i know, controls for a screensaver. im surprised too, why did i do this to myself)

keyboard triggers:

  1 – Toggle light/dark mode (switches the background and color palette)

  2 – Toggle physics mode (Bounce ↔ Wrap)

note: dont press 2. it's kinda broken right now

  3 / R – Reset everything (shapes snap back to the center with new velocities)

  O – Toggle outlines on the shapes

i made it with these little things:

  p5.js, JavaScript, HTML.
